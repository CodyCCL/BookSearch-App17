# BookSearch-App17
## Description
```
Most modern websites are driven by two things: data and user demands. The ability to personalize user data is the cornerstone of real-world web development today. And as user demands evolve, applications need to be more performant. This challenge is to refactor a fully functioning Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. The app was built using the MERN stack with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API. It's already set up to allow users to save book searches to the back end.
